You’ll learn:\r\n✅ How to organize your code like a well-planned city\r\n✅ How Bounded Contexts help avoid traffic jams in your architecture\r\n✅ How to define clear business domains so your software mirrors real-world processes\r\n\r\nWe’ll take these concepts from theory to practice with a live coding demo, where we build a sample app using DDD principles. By the end, you'll walk away with a clear roadmap for applying DDD to your own projects—so your software feels less like a chaotic sprawl and more like a well-designed metropolis.\r\n\r\n🚀 Join me to transform your messy code into a scalable, well-structured system!",

Engineering teams frequently struggle to balance rapid development with maintaining long-term code quality, leading to accumulating trade-offs that become bottlenecks in the future.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will demystify technical debt by breaking it down into its different types (intentional vs. unintentional, design debt vs. code debt) and explore strategies to manage and reduce it without disrupting business operations. Rather than treating tech debt as an afterthought, we’ll discuss proactive approaches to integrating technical improvements into the development lifecycle without sacrificing velocity.\r\n\r\nWe’ll cover:\r\n✅ The different types of technical debt (planned vs. unintentional)\r\n✅ How to measure and prioritize tech debt with objective metrics\r\n✅ Strategies for gradual refactoring vs. full rewrites\r\n✅ Techniques to convince stakeholders to invest in tech debt reduction\r\n✅ Real-world case studies from my experience leading engineering teams\r\n\r\nWhether you’re an engineer struggling with legacy code, a tech lead planning long-term improvements, or a manager balancing business priorities, this session will equip you with practical strategies to take control of your software’s future.",

For developers, this means that instead of developing with tools like Podman, Docker Compose etc, we can run a lightweight version of OpenShift on our laptops, or use a developer sandbox in the cloud, which ensures that what we developed will work in production, no surprises.\r\n\r\nIt also offers pre-created app templates and source-to-image (S2I) builds, which means in many cases we don't even have to worry about writing Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\nWe will explore some of the many OpenShift dev tools, including IDE integration, pre-architected templates, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and OpenShift Lightspeed, your AI powered virtual assistant.\r\n\r\nOverall, OpenShift enhances developer productivity by providing a more streamlined, secure, and scalable environment compared to other Kubernetes distributions.",

        "description": "Platform-agnosticism is a relative measure of how an app works the same way, irrespective of the operating system on which the app is running. \r\n\r\nFlutter is platform-agnostic because it gives users of Flutter-built apps the same experience across their different devices. Flutter is platform-agnostic through how it renders user interfaces and through platform channels.\r\n\r\nFor UI, Flutter's rendering uses multiple layers. Also, Flutter grabs a blank canvas on the target platform and paints as it likes. In addition, the same Flutter engine is shipped in every app so Flutter paints the Dart code in exactly the same way. \r\n\r\nFor Platform Channels, Dart (the flutter side) can call methods and listen to events whose declarations are found in the native side (of the target platform) and vice versa. This enables plugin development and streamlines native features in the Flutter app.\r\n\r\nIn this session, the audience will understand the crucial benefits of platform-agnosticism especially in this our modern times of the sovereignty of cross-platform tools. Furthermore, session participants will appreciate how Flutter achieves this fit of being platform-agnostic through rendering UI and using platform-channels.\r\n\r\nWe will walk through how a host/native app is different from the \"inner\" Flutter app and engine. We will also see how Dart's Binary Messenger serializes/deserializes function calls across both sides. Finally, the audience will grasp the difference with Flutter's execution on the Web as browsers are not Operating Systems.",

While it’s not something developers always interact with directly, it plays a critical role in aligning technology with long-term business goals.\r\n\r\nThis session offers a clear, grounded introduction to what EA is, how it works, and where it intersects with the work developers do. We’ll explore core concepts like capabilities, business architecture, technology architecture layers or views, and change impact - and show how EA helps create the conditions for scalable, future-ready systems.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re working in a fast-moving startup or a large enterprise, this session is about giving you a lens into the architectural decisions that shape the environments you build in every day.",
